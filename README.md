## Description

In this project, a YOLOv8 object detection model was used to address the challenge of visual pollution object detection. The model was trained using Ultralytics YOLOv8, the latest version of the YOLO object detection and image segmentation model. Using such a model on its early days may be not the best for its stability but using a new platform would be great for implementing its new and helpful applications.
YOLOv8 uses a number of architectural improvements over previous versions, such as a focus on smaller models and more efficient layers.
One of the best ways to make the model more scalable is by transfer learning. And with that, this model code be used for a much larger dataset as a starting point, which can greatly reduce the time and computation required to train a new model.
